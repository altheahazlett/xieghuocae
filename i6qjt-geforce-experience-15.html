I've talked to a couple of people that stream this game and I'm not sure why I'm having the issues I'm having. Specs: 4790k @ 4.0 32GB Ram GTX 1080 founders Windows 10 Pro Gigabit internet I try to stream this game but it is virtually impossible. I drop to like 15-30 fps and I can't tell why. Everyone that I have talked to does not have this issue. Here's a link, the effects are much more prominent towards the end of the paragon session. I've tried adjusting my graphic. The option for it is now disabled by default in Fortnite's settings. All you need to do to fix it is go into Settings > Game and scroll all the way to the bottom and turn on Shadow Play Highlights. Today, I was trying to update my Geforce Experience, when I encounter an error telling me .NET Framework ver. 4 is not installed, so Geforce couldn't install. I'm currently running .NET framework ver. 4.5 OS: Windows 7 Ultimate I just got my GTX 780 in the mail today and went to update the drivers and Geforce Experience is stuck installing the update at about 15%. I'm not entirely sure how to go about solving the issue because I don't want to stop the install and risk ruining anything. I followed the instructions in this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/3eeuau/nvidia_geforce_experience_cause_slow_startupboot/) and set streamer service to delayed start but to no avail. I even tried setting all 3 non-driver related services to delayed start (streamer service, network service, and GE service) and I'm still experiencing a 20 second long delay after the windows 7 logo and "starting windows" prompt. Prior to updating I was using an earlier version that didn't. Hello there, I am thinking about to upgrade my 970. I can still play the games I want with 60 fps but I would like to use the full potential of my 144Hz monitor. My few questions are: 1. is it worth it to upgrade the 970 with "just" a 1080p 144Hz monitor. 2. I am thinking about to upgrade to a 2070 or a 2080. Which one would be more value for me? I also considered a used 1080TI but I mostly got bad experiences with used electronical devices. 3. Are these cards to "overkill". Buying a pre-built PC from a store is rarely a good idea - most of the time you will overpay for outdated hardware and poor quality parts. So, in the wake of all the new VR headsets coming out soon, I made a detailed guide on building VR-ready PC on a budget. NOTE: I will not provide you with information on how to assemble it - there's plenty of information online (and it's quite simple process, anyone can do it). But I will provide you with a list of compatible, high quality and best priced.

Hello! I’ve owned an Alienware M11x R2 since 2010 and while it’s unable to play many modern games, it has endured. This thing has lasted me 9 years of heavy use, and it’ll certainly reach the decade mark. In that time I’ve dropped it countless times and even rolled over it while sleeping, snapping the screen off it and having to buy a new one. However, it has survived. These machines redefine durable, at least in my experience. It’s lasted well, but alas, a 1.20GHz Intel Core i7 640UM I have 3 questions. 1. How safe is it. I mean long term is it going to hurt my components. 2. How practical is it. I do a good amount of gaming and would like to experience those higher frame rates. 3. How is the best way to go about doing it. My build: PCPartPicker Part List (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/bJ4ZMZ) Type Item Price :---- :---- :---- CPU AMD - Ryzen 5 2600 3.4 GHz 6-Core Processor (https://pcpartpicker.com/product/jLF48d/amd-ryzen-5-2600-34ghz-6-core-processor-yd2600. I've learned some new things since my last performance guide (https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/9vbtzr/my_ultimate_bdo_performance_guide/). This should be easier to do and get you even more performance, especially on Ryzen. #In-game settings Disable low power mode. This one's a big deal. If you AFK lifeskill, disable it anyway. The game is reduced to 3FPS when in tray, so you don't have to worry about it. Low power mode makes the game sleep for about 10ms every frame 
So I don't remember my previous specs, but it was a mid-range iBuyPower all the way back from 2009-2010. It struggled to play 1080p videos if I had literally anything else running at the same time. Can't remember the GPU, but it was crappy. 4gb RAM is really all I remember. Been working at Best Buy for a while and saved up for a new rig. It's an Alienware but the price I actually got it for, well let's just say it was in no way a bad deal whatsoever. I'm absolutely loving </p>
